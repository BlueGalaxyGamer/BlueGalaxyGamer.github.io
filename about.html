                    <h2>About - THE MACH CLUB</h2>

                    <p>The Mach Club is an LDR, 
                    Leadership Development Requirements, aka: Club, 
                    in Air Force & Navy JROTC and ROTC units.</p>

                    <p>This club will teach all of the survival skills 
                    needed to survive in any conditions.
                    For example, how to fly a plane, what to do when you're 
                    stuck in the middle of the ocean, what happens when you're 
                    in the middle of an unknown forest and must survive in the 
                    wilderness. The skills are, piloting, land & air navigation, 
                    how to build a shelter & fire, what food can be eaten, etc.</p>

                    <p>Such skills are needed to join the US Armed Forces. 
                    However, this is NOT a recruitment platform.</p>

                <div class="indentedBox">
                    <p>1. PURPOSE. The purpose of this LOI is to outline and explain the details of The
                        Mach Club, TMC. TMC is a learning experience with hands-on tests called, The
                        Mach Club Fighter Attack Program/Competition, TMCFAP/TMCFAC. TMCFAP
                        starts after two weeks has passed since the start of the second month (two
                        weeks into December) of The Mach Club, starting every Friday. 
                        <hr>
                        <br>2. CONCEPT. The Idea of The Mach Club is to teach survival in three different
                        areas: Air, Land, & Sea. Air & Land survival will be tested at TMCFAP. Air
                        Survival will also be tested during Aerial Missions and Land Survival will be
                        tested during Ground Operations.
                        <hr>
                        <br>3. DUES & PHYSICALS. Any AFJROTC cadets participating in The Mach Club
                        must pay an activity fee of $315 to fully join. The fee covers the suit for flight
                        during Air Survival, the members squadron patch, aircraft patch, Aviator
                        Jacket, as well as activity fees. The cadet will have to pay for their own BLUE
                        JEANS, WHITE UNDERSHIRT, and BLACK TENNIS SHOES or COYOTE
                        BROWN BOOTS. The dues and the physical must be turned in before the first
                        competition, otherwise the cadet will be kicked out from the LDR.
                        <hr>
                        <br>4. SQUADRONS. Cadets in The Mach Club will be sorted into teams called
                        squadrons. Squadrons will consist of up to a minimum of 12 cadets, which can
                        be Male and Female. The suggested amount is 18 cadets in one squadron,
                        however the minimum to compete in TMCFAP is 12 cadets in one squadron.
                        <hr>
                        <br>5. THE SURVIVALS. The survivals are Air, Land, and Sea. The cadets will learn
                        how to survive in each area under any circumstances (that we are allowed to
                        simulate).
                        <br><br>a. AIR SURVIVAL/AVIATION. In air survival, we will put cadets into
                        simulators and allow them to fly an aircraft of their choice to fly against
                        enemy fighters & bombers. The game is called DCS World (Open Beta),
                        DCS stands for Digital Combat Simulator. This survival will refine the
                        cadets’ skills as a pilot, as well as their leadership, teamwork, and their
                        skills in aviation. In air survival, there is three events: CTF, BR, and
                        ACES.
                        <br>i. CTF. Capture The Flag. Capture enemy team’s flag.
                        <br>ii. BR. Bomber Run. Shoot down all enemy bombers and their
                        escorts.
                        <br>iii. ACES. Air Control/Superiority. Obtain air superiority.
                        <br><br>b. LAND/GROUND SURVIVAL. Land survival will teach cadets how to
                        survive in different environments, build shelters and fires, and how to
                        patrol. This survival will give the cadet the skills to survive in the wild. In
                        land survival, there is five events: SAR, REVA, INFIL, SAO, and RAAM.
                        <br>i. SAR. Search And Rescue. Search for the downed pilot and rescue
                        him/her.
                        <br>ii. REVA. Retrieval. Retrieve “stolen” information from enemy hands.
                        <br>iii. INFIL. Infiltrate. Infiltrate enemy lines and plant GPS locators for
                        the Air-To-Ground teams.
                        THE MACH CLUB
                        <br>iv. SAO. Save Our Souls. Team is placed behind enemy territory; they
                        must defend themselves until rescue arrives.
                        <br>v. RAAM. Rescue And Attack Mission. Combination of INFIL-SARREVA.
                        <br><br>a. SEA/WATER SURVIVAL. Water survival consists of learning what to do
                        when the cadet “crashes into the middle of the ocean”. They will learn
                        how to float without using too much energy, what they can use, and
                        what they can eat & drink.
                        <hr>
                        <br>6. FIGHTER ATTACK PROGRAM. TMCFAP is a competition held every Friday after
                        two weeks into December has passed. It is a competition that will test every
                        squadron’s ability/skill in the Air and on the Ground.
                        <hr>
                        <br>7. PRACTICES. Practices/Meetings will start at 15:30 (3:30 PM) and end around
                        18:00 (6:00 PM) from Monday to Thursday starting November.
                        <hr>
                        <br>8. CONDUCT. Cursing/Foul Language is never allowed, two warnings will be
                        issued, third time and the cadet will be told to leave practice immediately and a
                        call home will be made.
                        <hr>
                        <br>9. A warning to all cadets partaking in The Mach Club, there will be unexpected
                        situations that you will encounter. This will determine how well you can
                        coordinate with your team and adapt to the new situation to complete your
                        mission.
                        <hr>
                        10.We are what make The Mach Club, stronger than steel, and the made to be the
                        Best of the Best. HOORAH.</p>
